    <h1> Recent Experinece </h1>
     I have been working with sql and using that data I query and built interactive tableau dashboards to track go live dates for amazon stores and warehouses. These dashboards generate multiple reports on ad-hoc requests from the stakeholders such as how many new hires they would need to manage these go-lives, if the go-live dates are on track, update the go-live dates if necessary etc. Im a currently working on Amazon internal tool Quick Site for dashboard.

      <h1> Future Career Goal </h1>
     <p class="text"> I am currently building my skill sets to become Java Software Development Engineer from Business Data Analyst. I did my Bachelor Degree in Information System Management with minor in  Web Development and Design. It's my passion to development and design, it makes me feel like I can create by own virtual world.  Look at the links below to see some of my projects for web development. I have worked as a junior dev for few months before working as a aaplication support engineer, where I had worked with java, and sql in the backend. I am always looking forward to learning new technology.<br>
