    <h2> Recent Experinece </h2>
    <p> I built interactive tableau dashboards to track go live dates for amazon stores and warehouses. I pulled the data from amazon redshift and wrote complex SQL queries and created data sources based on those data in tableau desktop. These dashboards generate multiple reports on ad-hoc requests from the stakeholders such as how many new hires they would need to manage these go-lives, if the go-live dates are on track, update the go-live dates if necessary etc. <br>
 
The biggest challenge was to understand the data to build the queries. Finding the right data was really hard since it was spread all across and very ambiguous. Also there were challenges to find who owns which data and gather more knowledge about it. <br>
 
Ultimately I had to go through about 30 different data sources within redshift and had to look into multiple clusters and managed to pull them together into one place. It took me a pretty long time to figure out the sources correctly. Some knowledge sharing with likely owners of the data was also helpful to get some insights. Finally with a lot of efforts I was able to manage the data sources correctly and come up with the interactive reports.  </p>
