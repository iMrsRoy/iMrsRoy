## 💫 About Me
I’m a software and data engineer with a strong analytics foundation and a love for solving real-world problems through clean code and automation. My journey into tech began with dashboards, data, and SQL — but my curiosity led me into pipelines, APIs, and cloud engineering.

After 5+ years in analytical roles at Amazon and Mount Sinai, I made the leap into engineering by completing intensive full-stack and data engineering bootcamps. Now, I specialize in:

- ⚙️ **Backend Engineering:** Python, REST APIs, CI/CD  
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (S3, EC2, IAM), GitHub Actions  
- 🧠 **Data Engineering:** SQL, data pipelines, automation, A/B testing  
- 📊 **Analytics Integration:** Tableau, reporting tools, stakeholder insights

## 👩🏽‍🔧 What I do:
- 🐍 Write clean, scalable code in **Python, Java, and SQL**
- ☁️ Deploy cloud solutions using **AWS (S3, EC2, RDS)** and CI/CD pipelines
- 📈 Build data pipelines, automate reports, and wrangle complex datasets
- 💻 Design user-friendly dashboards and web applications (HTML/CSS/React)
- 🧠 Constantly learning, currently exploring **AI & ML engineering**

## 📚 Currently working on:
- 🌐 A full-stack wellness app for habit tracking
- 🧪 Automating fitness recommendations with AI
- ☁️ Prepping for **AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification** (May 2025)
- 🎓 BS in Information System Managment and Minor in Web Development
