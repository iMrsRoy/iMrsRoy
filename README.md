## 💫 About Me
I’m a software and data engineer with a strong analytics foundation and a love for solving real-world problems through clean code and automation. My journey into tech began with dashboards, data, and SQL — but my curiosity led me into pipelines, APIs, and cloud engineering.

After 5+ years in analytical roles at Amazon and Mount Sinai, I made the leap into engineering by completing intensive full-stack and data engineering bootcamps. Now, I specialize in:

- ⚙️ **Backend Engineering:** Python, REST APIs, CI/CD  
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (S3, EC2, IAM), GCP GitHub Actions  
- 🧠 **Data Engineering:** SQL, data pipelines, PostgreSQL, Pandas, automation, A/B testing, BigQuery   
- 📊 **Analytics Integration:** Excel, Tableau, reporting tools, stakeholder insights
- 💻 ** ETL/Data:** Snowflake, Google Analytics, Campaign Manager, Airflow
- 🌐 ** Other: ** Jira, Confluence, Agile, Stakeholder Reporting, A/B Testing, KPI Design, Marketing Attribution,
